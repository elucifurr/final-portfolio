## Overview

Nexus Banking is an online banking platform designed to offer users secure, fast, and reliable banking services. The application provides users with the ability to link their bank accounts, make quick transfers, view real-time balances, and monitor recent transactions. Built using Next.js for the front end and backed by Appwrite, Dwolla, and Plaid integrations, this project focuses on providing a smooth and secure user experience.

## Key Features

- **Bank Account Linking**: Integrated with Plaid to allow users to securely connect and manage their bank accounts within the application.
- **Fast Transfers**: Utilized Dwolla for facilitating instant and safe money transfers between linked accounts.
- **Real-Time Balances and Transactions**: Displayed up-to-date account balances and recent transactions for better user insight.
- **User Authentication**: Implemented secure authentication flows and authorization checks using Appwrite, ensuring data safety and user privacy.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: To create a fast and responsive web application with a focus on scalability and performance.
- **React**: For building dynamic user interfaces and managing complex state.
- **Appwrite**: As the backend platform for managing user authentication and database operations.
- **Dwolla**: To enable smooth, compliant money transfers.
- **Plaid**: For secure account linking and real-time transaction data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To ensure a modern and responsive UI across devices.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was managing security for financial data and complying with various banking standards. By working closely with Appwrite for user management and Dwolla and Plaid for financial data, I ensured that data handling remained secure and compliant. Additionally, managing asynchronous data updates to display real-time account information without performance loss was a key learning in optimizing Next.js applications.

## Outcome

The Nexus Banking application has been well-received for its usability and security features, helping users manage their finances more effectively. Its scalable design allows for future feature expansions, making it a robust foundation for any future banking-related enhancements.
